# pydrobert-speech

## What is it?

A library for converting audio signals to speech features, likely for speech
recognition.

## Layout

`pydrobert.speech` contains the following important submodules

1. `pre` : audio -> audio. Preprocess audio signals.
2. `scale` : produces scaling functions for placing filter banks in time.
   E.g. Mel-scale, Bark-scale, or uniform.
3. `filters` : scale -> filter bank. Produces factories of filters
   (e.g. Gabor), positioned according to input scale. The
   factory can generate the same filter in the frequency or time domain.
   `filters` also contains windowing functions, e.g.    Hann.
4. `compute` : audio, filter bank, window -> features. Produces features,
   given a filter bank and a signal. The object in `compute` controls the
   conversion. The standard, Short-Time-Fourier-Transform-based filter bank
   representation is, for example, `ShortTimeFourierTransformFrameComputer`.
5. `post` : features -> features. Post-processing features, e.g. CMVN.

These submodules naturally form a speech processing pipeline.

## Pipeline construction

Most objects in the library inherit from `AliasedFactory`. Parent classes
inheriting `AliasedFactory` can initialize children using configuration
hierarchies and aliases, e.g.

``` python
mel_scale = pydrobert.speech.scales.MelScaling()
gabor_bank = pydrobert.speech.filters.LinearFilterBank.from_alias(
   'gabor', 'mel', high_hz=5000)
stft_computer = pydrobert.speech.compute.FrameComputer.from_alias(
   'stft', {'alias': 'gabor', 'scaling_function': 'mel', 'high_hz': 5000},
    window_function='hann')
```

In the latter two lines, the first argument to `from_alias` specifies an
alias for a given child. For example, `GaborFilterBank.aliases` contains
`"gabor"`. The second argument to `from_alias` is passed as a positional
argument to the constructor of the child, and the third is passed as a keyword
argument. The positional arguments of the constructors of `gabor_bank` and
`stft_computer` are `scaling_function` and `bank`, which are expected to
be instances of `AliasedFactory` subclasses themselves. Hence, the object can
initialize the `AliasedFactory` arguments directly. In the above examples,
the positional arguments to `from_alias` are used to initialize values
identical to the previous lines' variables.

Most importantly, the `AliasedFactory` system allows for convenient
serialization of speech processing pipelines using JSON. JSON is used to
configure the pipeline for command-line usage.

## Command-line

The following commands are available via command-line:

- `compute-feats-from-kaldi-tables` (requires *pydrobert-kaldi*): Given
  `WavData` stored in a Kaldi table, write to another table the result of a
  speech processing pipeline
- `signals-to-torch-feat-dir` (requires *pytorch*): Given a text mapping of
  utterances to signal paths, write `torch.FloatTensor`s as a series of
  PyTorch archives, to be read with a `torch.utils.data.DataSet`. Consider
  pairing with `SpectDataSet` from *pydrobert-pytorch*.

## Other Utilities

- `pydrobert.speech.vis` contains functions for plotting various parts of
  the pipeline, including the filter frequency
  response and spectrogram-like representations of speech features. Requires
  *matplotlib*.
- `pydrobert.speech.utils.read_signal` is a very versatile function for
  reading signals from a variety of sources.
